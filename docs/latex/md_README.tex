C++ Template of practices in the course Metaheuristics in the course of Computer Science degree at the University of Granada.

This is a skeleton of the C++ for doing the practices, para

The main design criteria applied were\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To clearly separate the problem part from the algorithm
\item To make easier to change the algorithm maintaining the same API, see the main code.
\item To identify the files parts to maintain fixed (in $\ast$$\ast$/common$\ast$$\ast$ directory) for the files to be adapted.
\item To facilitate the creation of automatic tests.
